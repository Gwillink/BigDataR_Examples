What is this:
This is an example of an example

Objective:
The purpose is to convey how one should structure examples when developing them for this project.

Solution:
I plan to do this through a very basic Graphlab example using the pmf command line demo.

Value:
This should serve as a reference whenever writing examples.  It will build a consistent model around how we create examples minimizing the need for users to navigate ambiguity.  It will also cut development time of examples since we can use a consistent model for how we think about them.
