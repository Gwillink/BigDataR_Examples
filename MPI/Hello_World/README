Objective
---------
The purpose of this example is to show how you can mix multiple parallel constructs in a single program.

Solution
--------
We used MPI as a communication layer between nodes and OMP to leverage multiple cores on the processors of each node.

Value
-----
Understanding of how to compile a simple program with both constructs.
Extreme control over parallelism at the expense of programming complexity.
