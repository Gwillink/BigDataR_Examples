* Objective: *
**************
Compute ALS on the query click matrix.
I give an explanation of ALS here: https://github.com/koooee/BigDataR_Examples/tree/master/ExampleExample/Graphlab_pmf

*************
* Solution: *
*************
First we need a query matrix so we write some sql to extract that for us.
I pull back the click matrix as well, just for giggles.

Then we use graphlab to compute the factorization

**********
* Value: *
**********
How you can poorly use matrix factorizations with a blend of other basic benchmarks to generate recommendations


Notes:
A query matrix is the quantity of time a query,sku combination exists together
A click matrix is the quantity of times a user clicked on a given sku
