* Objective: *
**************
Generate 2 basic benchmarks so we can recommend to users who existed in the train set but don't exist in the test set
as well as recommend to user we simply just never knew about or product categories we've never seen before
*************
* Solution: *
*************
best_five.sql -- Simply compute the top 5 products with the most clicks.  We will use this when we have no data on anyone.
top_by_category.sql -- Compute the top 5 clicked on products for every product category.  We will use this when the user doesn't exist in train but exists in test

**********
* Value: *
**********
Help us recommend users even though we don't have much information on them
