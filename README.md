What is an Example?
===================

An Example is a transfer of knowledge that is compeling and easily understood.

How do you do that?
===================

An example must be in the form 
  Objective -> Solution -> Value
Without these three characteristics, understanding a new concept is difficult.

Objective
=========
Define what it is the example is trying to solve and why it is important.

Solution
========
Define How it aims to solve the problem.  Consider inputs to an example, Why do we need them? What do they do?

Value
=====
With any example there is an outcome.  How do I interpret it? What can I do with it? Why is it valueable?
