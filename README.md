What is an Example?
===================

An Example is a transfer of knowledge that is compeling and easily understood.

How do you do that?
===================

An example must be in the form 
  Objective  ->   Solution  ->  Value
Without these three characteristics, understanding a new concept is difficult.


Every Readme file to an example must contain these 3 sections in this order
===========================================================================

Objective:
=========
Define what the example is trying to solve and why it is important.

Solution:
========
Define how it aims to solve the objective.  Consider inputs and parameters to an example, Why do we need them? What do they do? How do they change the output?

Value:
======
Why is the solution valueable? How do I interpret it? What can I do with it?
