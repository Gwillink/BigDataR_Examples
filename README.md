Machine Learning Examples for BigDataR Linux

What is an Example?
===================

An Example is a transfer of knowledge that is compeling and easily understood.

How do you do that?
-------------------

An example must be in the form:  
1. Objective.  
2. Solution.  
3. Value.  

Without these three characteristics, understanding a new concept is difficult.


All README files to an example must contain the following
=========================================================

Objective:
---------
**Define what the example is trying to solve and why it is important.**  

Solution:
---------
**Define how it aims to solve the objective.**  
Consider inputs and parameters to an example:  
Why do we need them?  
What do they do?  
How do they change the output?  

Value:
------
**What is the outcome and why do we need it.**  
Why is the solution valueable?  
How do I interpret it?  
What can I do with it?  

*END All README files to an example must contain the following*  

Disclaimer
----------
Don't take all of the questions above in the literal sense and simply answer them.  
The abstract thought here is these three items (Objective, Solution, Value) formulate a foundation for why we do something.  
If we can answer the foundational questions, we can build holistic examples.
